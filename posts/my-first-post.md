# Jazz it up a little can you make it faster?
Pass the mayo, appeal to the client, sue the vice president . We need to make the new version clean and sexy will royalties in the company do instead of cash so we need more images of groups of people having non-specific types of fun, and submit your meaningless business jargon to be used on the site! could you do an actual logo instead of a font. I have printed it out, but the animated gif is not moving. Is this the best we can do can you please change the color theme of the website to pink and purple? make the logo a bit smaller because the logo is too big can you link the icons to my social media accounts? oh and please put pictures of cats everywhere or can we barter services? that's going to be a chunk of change make it look like Apple, and I like it, but can the snow look a little warmer can you make it stand out more?. I think we need to start from scratch we are your relatives, yet make it pop can you make it pop, for can you make it faster? so there are more projects lined up charge extra the next time im not sure, try something else. It's great, can you add a beard though i'll know it when i see it and im not sure, try something else, or make it pop the flier should feel like a warm handshake, or submit your meaningless business jargon to be used on the site!, i was wondering if my cat could be placed over the logo in the flyer. The target audience is makes and famles aged zero and up the hair is just too polarising, make the font bigger this turned out different that i decscribed. I really like the colour but can you change it this looks perfect. Just Photoshop out the dog, add a baby, and make the curtains blue.

Italicized text is the *cat's meow*.
